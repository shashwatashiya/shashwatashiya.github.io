I was sitting at my desk reading as I noticed a bird stuck in a net. 

The bird went up and down and left and right but couldn’t get out of the net. 

All the bird had to do was retrace its steps back to the entry point and take a different route. 

Too late, the bird is dead since it couldn’t keep up with the compute.
